# PLANT-LEAF-DISEASE-DETECTION
Development of three different CNN architectures namely AlexNet, VGG-16, and custom architecture, incorporate transfer learning and image processing techniques and comparison of the efficiency of three models.


**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

Getting affected by diseases is very common in plants. Plant pathogens cause severe loss in terms of economics and production in the agriculture sector. Proper nursing of agricultural crops and early detection of disease is crucial for maintaining sustainability. Any system or technique that identifies the disease in early stages before the crop gets ruined would aid the farmers immensely. Also, India loses 35% of the annual crop yield due to only plant diseases. Thus, early detection of these diseases can save us from huge loss. Early detection of plant diseases however, remains very difficult due to the lack of lab infrastructure and expertise. Through this project we wanted to explore the possibility of computerized approaches for scalable and early plant disease detection. We have sought to Convolution neural networks to help us predict the disease of the plant. Furthermore, we have compared various CNN architectures like Custom Architecture, Alex Net, and VGG and tried to analyse which model gave best results for our dataset.

**OBJECTIVE:**

To differentiate between a healthy plant and a plant by watching the detectable change in colour, form, or function of the plant in response to the pathogen that causes leaf spots, blight, rots, damping-off, anthracnose, dieback, and canker, it is possible to distinguish between a healthy plant and a plant that is affected by a disease. Therefore, being able to recognize these changes in the plant will enable us to determine what kind of sickness the plant is suffering from and if it is healthy or not.
